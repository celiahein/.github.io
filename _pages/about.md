I am a PhD Candidate at the [University of Toronto](https://eeb.utoronto.ca/) in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology with supervisor [Helene Wagner](https://sites.utm.utoronto.ca/wagnerlab/).

My thesis research is focused on investigating the drivers of community assemblies. I'm interested in how habitat, environment, and species contribute to forming the ecological communities we see today. This goal of separating pattern from process to generalize how communities form is essential for predicting what these communities may look like in different future scenarios (e.g. climate change and human development). I'm currently investigating drivers of the wild bee community across the entire agricultural zone of Alberta, Canada.
