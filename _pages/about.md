I am a PhD Candidate at the [University of Toronto](https://eeb.utoronto.ca/) in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology with supervisor [Helene Wagner](https://sites.utm.utoronto.ca/wagnerlab/).

My thesis research is focused on the role of spatial scale in species modelling. Scale is the lens we look through when linking pattern to process in landscape ecology, and understanding  how the scale of observation affects ecological measurements and models is essential to creating species distribution models that are interpretable and useful in explaining and predicting species distributions. I am currently modelling scale-dependency and "categorizing" the scale-trend types for species-landcover associations using an empircial dataset of bee species sampled in the agricultural region of Alberta, Canada.
