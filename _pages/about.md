I am a PhD Candidate at the [University of Toronto](https://eeb.utoronto.ca/) in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology with supervisor [Helene Wagner](https://sites.utm.utoronto.ca/wagnerlab/).

My thesis research is focused on investigating the drivers of community assemblies. I'm interested in how habitat, environment, and species contribute to forming the ecological communities we see today. This goal of separating pattern from process to generalize how communities form is essential for predicting what these communities may look like in different future scenarios (e.g. climate change and human development). I'm currently investigating drivers of the wild bee communitity across the entire agricultural zone of Alberta, Canada.

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

Example: editing a markdown file for a talk
